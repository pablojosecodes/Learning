### What is Capitalism? That is the question

Overarching points



1. Think of economics in a more expansive way (referencing older models of political economy (also social, cultural, and environmental)
2. Think about the evidence for our views- how do we judge what is good information or knowledge? What role does our media ecologies play in shaping our views? Think more critically and in-depth through discussions + debates
3. Big and small picture

What is anthropology?



* Very interesting field of study that explores how people understand, relate to, and act in the world.


### Debating inequality

Two angles used in class



1. Wide angle- theories + datasets
2. Close up- ethnographic focus on people’s everyday lives + experiences

Expanding economic inequality



* How much of a problem is it + how concerning? What is the evidence?
* What are the reasons causing it?

Some facts



* 1929-2018, 
    * share of all pre-tax national income in the US flowing to top 10% went from 25% -> 47%
    * National income to top 1%: 11% -> 19%
    * Total income to bottom 50%: 20% -> 14%

Manufacturing



* 1960: ⅓ in manufacturing, 62% unionized
* 2010: ⅛ in manufacturing, 13.6% unionized

Temp work



* 2.7M temp workers in 2013
* ⅕ job growth since Great Recession has been in temp sector
* Largest growth in temp work has been blue collaw
* Temps earn &lt;25% permanent workers, 2x injuries, less benefits + pensions

Capital (Piketty)



* Looks at dynamics  + distribution of wealth between / within countries since 18th century
* r>g
    * “When rate of return on capital significantly exceeds the growth rate of the economy, then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income.”


### Information Ecologies

Key shifts in media ecologies in the US



1. Newspapers shift from working class audiences
2. Demise of Fairness Doctrine
3. Rise of cable broadcasts
4. Tech companies outside regulatory frameworks

The result has been that media with recognized standards is behind paywalls, and misinformation continues to spread.


### Nineteenth Century Political Economy

Adam Smith

Karl Marx

Periods of EU colonialism

1500s-1600s



* Spain, Portugal- control over water routes, search for precious metals

1600s-1700s



* England, France, Dutch plantation economies, slavery, trading companies (ie. East India Trading Company)

1890s



* Peak EU colonialism, Scramble for Africa

Wealth of Nations 



1. What makes some nations wealthier than others
2. What impact does the division of labor have/ Why does the division of labor intensify in certain settings?
3. Why do people engage in “truck, barter, and exchange”?
4. How/Why did the user of money arise?
5. What is the difference between “value in use” and “value in exchange”? (pg. 34)
6. Is “capitalism” positive or negative for Smith?

Taxes

Invisible hand

Critique of mercantilism

Free trade

Communist Manifesto



1. What are the two broad classes Marx sees society as dividing into/ WHy are they diving in this way?
2. What is work life like for industrial workers? Why?
3. How does industry under capitalism differ from “modes of productions in other historical epochs? What makes it distinctive? Is profit legitimate for Marx?
4. What kinds of relationships between different parts of the world does capitalism encourage?
5. What does Marx see as the political outcome of the logics and contradictions of capitalism? 

What kind of society does each one see capitalism as creating? 


### Capitalism and Culture


##### Max Weber (1846-1920)

Questions



* How is a status group different from a class?
* How many classes are there? Do classes form a “community”?
* How do political parties relate to status or class groups?

For Weber, what distinguishes capitalism from other historical economic systems:



* In Capitalism, ALL needs are commodified. Historically, buying some things + living off subsistence
* Rationalistic capitalist organization of **free wage labor**
* Interest in gain throughout history, but, under capitalism, a  particular way of looking at profit that emphasizes investing back into enterprises
* Separation of business from household economics; rationalization of economic activity and investment
* A particular ethos or spirit

In “The Protestant Ethic and SPirit of Capitalism”- Weber argues



* Origins of capitalism also emerged fro ideas and beliefs, not just economic relations
* For Weber, ideas of Calvinists and other Protestant groups that emphasized material prosperity as sign of god’s favor but also discouraged indulgence contributed to creating logics that would underpin capitalism
* Led Protestants like Ben Franklin to emphasize hard work
* Ideas are not cause of capitalism, but a factor that can’t be reduced to the economic; history is always multi-causal


#### Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002)

(Lower Class French, philosophy/sociology/anthropology)

Kinds of capital



* Economic
* Cultural 
* Social


#### Sherry Ortner (1941-Present)

(Middle class Anthropologist, feminist theorist)



* How does her take on “class” differ from the other theorists we’ve read?
* How do gender/sexuality and race relate to class differences? WHat does “displacement” mean for Ortner?
* How might Ortner’s ideas about “class” be seen as combining the ideas of Weber and Bourdieu?


### Debating Capitalism after WWII


#### Karl Polanyi

(classic economic historian)



* Shift to idea of self-regulating market entails a shift from market practices being embedded in society to society being embedded in market

Does Polanyi agree with Smith’s argument that there is a natural human tendency to “truck, barter, and exchange”?

Ways of organizing economic life pre-19th century



* Reciprocity
* Redistribution
* Householding

On markets



* Historically, people did not depend on markets for the needs of everyday life.
* Long-distance and local markets were instead often kept separate by local regulators
* As a result, Polanyi argues “global” markets did NOT evolve from “local” ones as Smith suggests; instead they were brought in by government interventions like mercantilist chart companies

Polanyi argues that treating land, labor, money money as commodities has socially destructive consequences- Why? Why does he call them “fictitious commodities”?

Where self-regulating market societies emerge: 



* A “double movement” emerges in response
* Ie. along with the expansion of market society there is an expansion of efforts of society to protect itself from destructive tendencies of seeing land, labor, and money as commodities)

Can you have a “free market” society



* Polanyi argues that ht idea of a self-regulating market is a myth and that “laissez faire was planned”- what does he mean by this?


#### Friedrich von Hayek (1899-1992)

(high class Austrian economist, proponent of free market)

What choices are there?



* ”Man in a complex society can have no choice but between adjusting himself to what to him must seem the blind forces of the social process [i.e. the market] and obeying the orders of a superior. So long as he knows only the hard discipline of the market, he may well think the direction by some other intelligent human brain preferable [i.e. centralized government]; but, when he tries it, he soon discovers that the former still leaves him at least some choice, while the latter leaves him none, and that it is better to have a choice between several unpleasant alternatives than being coerced into one.” (Individualism: True Or False, pg. 24)

On addressing economic inequality



* “We can leave each individual to find his own level.”
* [Individualism.. “also denies government the right to limit what the able or fortunate may achieve. It is equally opposed to any rigid limitation of the position individuals may achieve, whether this power is used to perpetuate inequality or to create equality.”
* “From the point of view of individualism there would not appear to exist even any justification for making all individuals start on the same level by preventing them from profiting by advantages which they have in no way earned, such as being born to parents who are more intelligent or conscientious than the average.”
* (Individualism: True Or False, pg. 16 + 30)

Summary of Hayek



* Sees capitalism as the system that best allows individuals freedom
* Worries about tendency for governments to become authoritarian out of ostensible desire to do good
