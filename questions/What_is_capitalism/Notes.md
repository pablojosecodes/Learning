### What is Capitalism? That is the question

Overarching points



1. Think of economics in a more expansive way (referencing older models of political economy (also social, cultural, and environmental)
2. Think about the evidence for our views- how do we judge what is good information or knowledge? What role does our media ecologies play in shaping our views? Think more critically and in-depth through discussions + debates
3. Big and small picture

What is anthropology?



* Very interesting field of study that explores how people understand, relate to, and act in the world.


### Debating inequality

1. Wide angle- theories + datasets
2. Close up- ethnographic focus on people’s everyday lives + experiences

* What are the reasons causing it?

Some facts

    * share of all pre-tax national income in the US flowing to top 10% went from 25% -> 47%
    * National income to top 1%: 11% -> 19%
    * Total income to bottom 50%: 20% -> 14%

Manufacturing

Capital (Piketty)



* Looks at dynamics  + distribution of wealth between / within countries since 18th century
* r>g
    * “When rate of return on capital significantly exceeds the growth rate of the economy, then it logically follows that inherited wealth grows faster than output and income.”


### Information Ecologies

Key shifts in media ecologies in the US



1. Newspapers shift from working class audiences
